- 👋 Hi, I’m @AngelinaF06
- I am an Undergraduate aiming for a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity at FIU.
- One of my very own project is the creation of my "ShopNotes" app's "skeleton" (coding structure), please don't hesitate to check it out and tell me what I could improve, I am open to criticism. :)
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding and data learning. For now, I am passionate and very fond of Java, I am still a beginner thus, I know variables, loops and printing. Java made me more interested in coding in general, thus,I would love to start building projects that can be useful to everyone, such as a calculator or a shopping list program. An other coding language that I know includes SQL, I am still at a beginner's stage, but I know this is very important language to communicate with a database, so I plan to work on it as well.
- 🌱 My mission is to make the world a safer through the innovating but risky A.I. age.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
