- 👋 Hi, I’m @AngelinaF06
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding and data learning. For now, I am passionate and very fond of Java, I am still a beginner thus, I know variables, loops and printing. Java made me more interested in coding in general, thus,I would love to start building projects that can be useful to everyone, such as a calculator or a shopping list program. An other coding language that I know includes SQL, I am still at a beginner's stage, but I know this is very important language to communicate with a database, so I plan to work on it as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently aiming to get a bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity. My mission is to make the world a safer through the innovating but risky A.I. age.
